# Introduction to Azure Resource Manager #

---

<a name="Overview" />
## Overview ##

A growing expectation of any cloud offering is the ability to automate the deployment and management of infrastructure components, like virtual machines, networks, storage, and databases - and enable customers to build and manage higher level applications on top of these in a rich DevOps friendly way. The Azure Resource Manager, provides a **Language** (Cloud Service Template Language) that allows a declarative, parameterized description (a **Template**) of a set of related resources, so that they may be deployed and managed as a unit. The Templates are text-based (JSON), making it easy to use them with source code control systems like TFS and Git.

>**Note:** When you first start Visual Studio, you must select one of the predefined settings collections. Each predefined collection is designed to match a particular development style and determines window layouts, editor behavior, IntelliSense code snippets, and dialog box options. The procedures in this lab describe the actions necessary to accomplish a given task in Visual Studio when using the **General Development Settings** collection. If you choose a different settings collection for your development environment, there may be differences in the steps that you should take into account.
